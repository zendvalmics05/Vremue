# Vremue

Vremue is a compile-time mathematics library that can be used to compute mathematical functions both at runtime and compile time.
It uses template meta-programming and modern C++20 features to achieve this.

The functions that are currently supported are:

abs(), signum(), sum(), difference(), product(), quotient(), reminder(), gcd(), lcm(), max(), min(), permutation(), combination(), factorial().
